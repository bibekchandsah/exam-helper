# Audio Visualization Features

## Overview
The Exam Helper now includes a professional real-time audio waveform visualization to help users understand how loudly they need to speak when asking questions via voice input.

## Features

### 1. Real-time Waveform Display
- **Professional Waveform**: Shows live audio waveform similar to professional audio software
- **Smooth Animation**: Real-time waveform updates with smooth scrolling
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate visual response to voice input
- **Glow Effects**: Cyan waveform with white glow for enhanced visibility

### 2. Intelligent Threshold System
- **Dynamic Threshold Line**: Orange dotted line showing optimal speaking level
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects when voice is above threshold
- **Visual Guidance**: Clear indication of when you're speaking loud enough
- **Adjustable Sensitivity**: Threshold can be adjusted for different environments

### 3. Professional Grid Display
- **Grid Lines**: Subtle grid lines for precise level reading
- **Center Reference**: Clear center line for amplitude reference
- **Dark Theme**: Professional dark background matching the app design
- **High Contrast**: Excellent visibility in all lighting conditions

### 4. Smart Display Integration
- **Auto-show**: Visualization appears automatically when audio is enabled
- **Auto-hide**: Visualization disappears when audio is disabled
- **Bottom Position**: Positioned for easy monitoring without interference
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different window sizes

## How to Use

### Enabling Audio Visualization
1. Click the **"ðŸŽ¤ Audio"** button to enable audio scanning
2. The waveform visualization panel will automatically appear
3. Start speaking to see real-time waveform feedback

### Reading the Waveform
- **Cyan Waveform**: Live audio waveform showing your voice pattern
- **Orange Threshold Line**: Dotted line showing minimum recommended level
- **Level Display**: Numerical value showing current audio intensity
- **Grid Reference**: Use grid lines to gauge consistent speaking levels

### Optimal Speaking Guidelines
- **Above Threshold**: Keep your voice above the orange threshold line
- **Consistent Amplitude**: Aim for steady waveform peaks
- **Clear Articulation**: Speak clearly to see distinct waveform patterns
- **Proper Distance**: Maintain 6-12 inches from microphone for best results

## Technical Details

### Audio Processing
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz for high-quality audio capture
- **Update Rate**: 20 Hz (50ms intervals) for smooth animation
- **Waveform Processing**: Real-time amplitude analysis with downsampling
- **Level Calculation**: RMS (Root Mean Square) energy calculation
- **Data Management**: Circular buffers for efficient memory usage

### Performance
- **Optimized Rendering**: Smooth waveform drawing with minimal CPU impact
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-50ms latency for immediate visual feedback
- **Memory Efficient**: Fixed-size buffers prevent memory leaks
- **Smooth Animation**: Anti-aliased waveform rendering for professional appearance

## Troubleshooting

### No Visualization Appearing
1. Ensure audio is enabled (green "Audio: On" status)
2. Check microphone permissions
3. Verify microphone is working in other applications

### Low Audio Levels
1. Check microphone volume in system settings
2. Move closer to microphone
3. Speak louder or more clearly
4. Check for background noise interference

### Visualization Not Updating
1. Restart audio scanning (disable/enable audio button)
2. Check system audio drivers
3. Ensure no other applications are using the microphone exclusively

## Testing
Use the included `test_audio_visualization.py` script to test the audio visualization independently:

```bash
python test_audio_visualization.py
```

This will open a standalone window with just the audio visualization for testing purposes.

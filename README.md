pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Install Tesseract OCR

**Windows:**
```bash
winget install UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR
```
Or download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

### Step 3: Configure API Keys
1. Run the application: `python exam_helper.py`
2. The application will create a `config.json` file automatically
3. Use the model selection dropdowns to choose your preferred AI models:
   - **Image Recognition**: OpenAI GPT-4o, Gemini Pro Vision, etc.
   - **Audio Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper, Gemini models
   - **AI Response**: OpenAI GPT models, Gemini Flash/Pro
4. Enter your API keys in the configuration file or through the interface
5. Adjust other preferences as needed

### üîß Building Executable

To create your own standalone executable:

```bash
# Method 1: Advanced build with progress tracking
python build_exe.py

# Method 2: Simple one-click build (takes long time with large application size)
build_simple.bat

# Method 3: Simple one-click build (takes less time with less application size)
build_optimize.bat

# Method 4: almost same time with same size application
build_executable.bat
build.bat

# Method 5: Manual PyInstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed exam_helper.py
```


See `BUILD_GUIDE.md` for detailed build instructions.

## Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
python exam_helper.py
```

### Basic Operations
1. **Automatic Scanning**: The app continuously scans for questions
2. **Manual Questions**: Type questions in the input box
3. **Screenshot Analysis**: Click "üì∏ Capture Screen" or press Ctrl+Shift+C
4. **View Answers**: Responses appear in the main display area
5. **Toggle Modes**: Switch between short and detailed answers
6. **Control Scanning**: Start/Stop OCR and Audio scanning independently
7. **Hide/Show**: Use Ctrl+Shift+H or the Hide button
8. **Always on Top**: Toggle to keep window above other applications

### Stealth Mode
- Automatically hides from most screen sharing applications
- Window remains visible to you but not in recordings
- Works with Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, Discord, and more

## Configuration

### Settings File: `config.json`
```json
{
  "openai_api_key": "your-api-key-here",
  "scan_interval": 3,
  "audio_enabled": true,
  "ocr_enabled": true,
  "response_mode": "short"
}
```

### Available Options
- **scan_interval**: Seconds between screen scans (default: 3)
- **audio_enabled**: Enable/disable microphone listening
- **ocr_enabled**: Enable/disable screen text capture
- **response_mode**: "short" for brief answers, "detailed" for explanations

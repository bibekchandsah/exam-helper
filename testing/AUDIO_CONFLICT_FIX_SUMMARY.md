# Audio Conflict Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The exam helper was experiencing audio conflicts with the error:
```
"This audio source is already inside a context manager"
```

This occurred because both the speech recognition (`listen_for_question()`) and the audio monitoring (`_audio_monitor_loop()`) were trying to access the microphone simultaneously using different context managers.

## Root Cause
- The original `listen_for_question()` method used `with self.microphone as source:` 
- The audio monitoring thread also tried to access the microphone through PyAudio
- This created a resource conflict where both tried to control the same audio device

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Integrated Audio Processing
- **Single Audio Stream**: Now uses one PyAudio stream for both visualization and speech detection
- **Unified Monitoring**: The `_audio_monitor_loop()` handles both RMS calculation and speech detection
- **Queue-based Communication**: Speech segments are queued for processing instead of direct microphone access

### 2. Voice Translator Style Visualization
- **Professional Waveform**: Implemented the same visualization style as your voice_translator.py
- **RMS-based Display**: Shows real-time RMS levels with filled waveform
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts visualization scale based on maximum RMS seen
- **Color-coded Feedback**: 
  - Green bar/text when above threshold (speech detected)
  - Blue bar when below threshold (background noise)
  - Orange threshold line (dashed)

### 3. Conflict Prevention
- **Resource Management**: Only one thread accesses the microphone
- **Conditional Access**: `listen_for_question()` now checks if monitoring is active
- **Proper Cleanup**: Enhanced cleanup methods to prevent resource leaks

## Key Changes Made

### Audio Module (`audio_module.py`)
```python
# Added integrated speech detection
self.speech_buffer = []
self.speech_queue = queue.Queue()

# Enhanced monitoring loop with speech detection
def _audio_monitor_loop(self):
    # Single stream handles both visualization and speech detection
    # RMS calculation for visualization
    # Speech segment detection and queuing
    
# New methods for speech processing
def get_speech_from_queue(self):
def process_speech_audio(self, audio_data):
```

### Exam Helper (`exam_helper.py`)
```python
# Updated audio scanning to use queue-based approach
def audio_scan_loop(self):
    # Gets speech from monitoring queue instead of direct microphone access
    audio_data = self.audio_capture.get_speech_from_queue()
    
# Voice translator style visualization
def update_audio_visualization(self):
def draw_background_grid(self):
def draw_threshold_line(self):
def draw_current_level(self):
def draw_rms_history(self):
```

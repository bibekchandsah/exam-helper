- **Smart Detection**: Automatically identifies likely questions using heuristics

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Answers
- **Dual AI Integration**: OpenAI for text, Perplexity for vision analysis
- **Perplexity Vision**: Advanced image analysis for screenshot-based questions
- **Response Modes**: Toggle between short/direct and detailed/explanatory answers
- **Question Analysis**: Automatically categorizes question types (math, definition, explanation, etc.)
- **Context Awareness**: Provides relevant and accurate answers

### üëª Stealth Mode
- **Screen Sharing Protection**: Hides from screen capture applications (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- **Always Visible**: Remains visible to the user while hidden from recordings
- **Transparency Control**: Adjustable window transparency
- **Click-through Mode**: Optional mouse event pass-through

### ‚å®Ô∏è User Interface
- **Floating Window**: Always-on-top, resizable interface (toggleable)
- **Quick Toggle**: Ctrl+Shift+H hotkey to hide/show instantly
- **Screenshot Vision**: Ctrl+Shift+C hotkey for instant screenshot capture and AI analysis
- **Real-time Display**: Live answer updates with timestamps
- **Settings Panel**: Easy configuration of API keys and preferences
- **Always on Top**: Checkbox to toggle window staying on top
- **Always on Top**: Checkbox to toggle window staying on top

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
2. **Tesseract OCR** for text recognition
3. **OpenAI API Key** for AI responses

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
python install_dependencies.py
```

Or manually install:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Install Tesseract OCR

**Windows:**
```bash
winget install UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR
```
Or download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

### Step 3: Configure API Keys
1. Run the application: `python exam_helper.py`
2. Click "Settings" button
3. Enter your OpenAI API key (for text questions)
4. Enter your Perplexity API key (for image analysis)
5. Adjust other preferences as needed

## Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
python exam_helper.py
```

### Basic Operations
1. **Automatic Scanning**: The app continuously scans for questions
2. **Manual Questions**: Type questions in the input box
3. **Screenshot Analysis**: Click "üì∏ Capture Screen" or press Ctrl+Shift+C
4. **View Answers**: Responses appear in the main display area
5. **Toggle Modes**: Switch between short and detailed answers
6. **Control Scanning**: Start/Stop OCR and Audio scanning independently
7. **Hide/Show**: Use Ctrl+Shift+H or the Hide button
8. **Always on Top**: Toggle to keep window above other applications

### Stealth Mode
- Automatically hides from most screen sharing applications
- Window remains visible to you but not in recordings
- Works with Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, Discord, and more

## Configuration

### Settings File: `config.json`
```json
{
  "openai_api_key": "your-api-key-here",
  "scan_interval": 3,
  "audio_enabled": true,
  "ocr_enabled": true,
  "response_mode": "short"
}
```

### Available Options
- **scan_interval**: Seconds between screen scans (default: 3)
- **audio_enabled**: Enable/disable microphone listening
- **ocr_enabled**: Enable/disable screen text capture
- **response_mode**: "short" for brief answers, "detailed" for explanations

## Technical Details

### OCR Processing
- Uses Tesseract OCR with OpenCV preprocessing
- Applies noise reduction and image enhancement
- Filters out non-question text automatically

### Audio Processing
- Real-time speech recognition using Google Speech API
- Microphone calibration for ambient noise
- Voice activity detection to reduce false positives

### Stealth Implementation
- Uses Windows API calls to hide from screen capture
- SetWindowDisplayAffinity with WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE
- Layered window attributes for transparency control

### AI Integration
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for question answering
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Error handling for network and API issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No OpenAI API key configured"**
- Add your API key in Settings
- Ensure the key has sufficient credits

**"Tesseract not found"**
- Install Tesseract OCR (see installation steps)
- On Windows, may need to set path manually in `ocr_module.py`

**"Microphone not working"**
- Check microphone permissions
- Ensure microphone is not used by other applications
- Try running as administrator

**"Stealth mode not working"**
- Run as administrator for full functionality
- Some screen capture apps may still detect the window
- Try adjusting transparency settings

### Performance Tips
- Increase scan_interval for better performance
- Disable audio or OCR if not needed
- Close other resource-intensive applications
